Final Keyword Use Cases
Constants: Declaring variables as final when they represent constants.
Immutable Classes: Combining final with private fields and no setters helps create immutable classes.When you want to prevent classes to get extended
Ensuring Method Behavior: Making certain methods final when you donâ€™t want them to be overridden, preserving specific logic in subclasses.
Preventing Inheritance: Declaring a class as final when you want to prevent it from being extended, like with the String class in Java.
